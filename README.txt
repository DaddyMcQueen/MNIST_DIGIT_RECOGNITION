 MNIST Hand Written Digits Dataset problem
 
 This is a deep neural network that can be
 trained to sometimes recognize the 
 handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

 It is still stupid and needs the following:
 - export/ import weights and biases
 - randomize order of training data to allow
   for epochs 
 - add function to nn for testing
 - add statistics after test
 - add graphics / ease of use
 - add input for user to draw digit and
   have network predict it

 Also github wont let me upload the data 
 so you gotta go to 
 http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
 and download the 4 files unzip them and 
 rename them so that the dot after 'images' 
 or 'labels' becomes a dash


 you also need to install a few python modules

 - numpy 
 - mnist

 pip commands:
 pip install numpy
 pip install python-mnist
