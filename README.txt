 MNIST Hand Written Digits Dataset problem
 
 This is a deep neural network that can be
 trained to recognize the handwritten digits 
 from the MNIST dataset with a ~90% accuracy

 It still needs the following:
 - add graphics / ease of use
 - add input for user to draw digit and
   have network predict it

 Also github wont let me upload the data 
 so you gotta go to 
 http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
 and download the 4 files unzip them and 
 rename them so that the dot after 'images' 
 or 'labels' becomes a dash

 just put the data in a folder and update the 
 directory in 'mnistload.py'

 you also need to install a few python modules

 - numpy 
 - mnist
 - pickel
